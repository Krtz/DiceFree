# DiceFree — Thief Tier II — design interview

**Created:** 2026-10-20  
**Status:** NORMAL WORLD 1 TIER II THIEF — **ROUND 1 USER DECISIONS CONFIRMED (2026-10-21)**. Dual one-handed daggers, Mana only, short stealth with bonus damage on its first breaking normal autoattack, and mixed fast-assassin/agile-duelist/dirty-tricks fantasy approved. Appearance asset selection is DEFERRED to separate working chat/Codex after reviewing user-downloaded assets; class mentor/quest design deferred until AFTER major city. Exact combat skills, stealth rules, damage values and dual-attack cadence OPEN. **DESIGN ONLY; NO UNITY C#/SCENE/ASSET/BUILD/SAVE CHANGES.**  
**Branch:** `integration/world1-foundation`  
**Links:** [Class Progression](../CLASS_PROGRESSION.md), [Physically Blessed Novice](PHYSICALLY_BLESSED_NOVICE.md), [Tier II Core Classes v0.2](../TIER2_CORE_CLASSES_DESIGN_V02.md), [Stats and Damage](../STATS_AND_DAMAGE.md), [Combat](../COMBAT.md), [Class Requirements](../CLASS_REQUIREMENTS_AND_DISCOVERY.md), [Ranger Tier II](RANGER_TIER2_DESIGN.md), [Completed Acolyte Tier II](ACOLYTE_TIER2_DESIGN.md).

## Confirmed World 1 design scope

Exactly eight ordinary Tier II classes in World 1:
- Physically Blessed Novice → Greatblade, Defender, Ranger, **Thief**.
- Magically Touched Novice → Mage, Priest, Acolyte, Psion.

**USER APPROVED CLASS AND SEQUENCE (2026-10-20):** Acolyte Tier II design is now completed as a reference baseline. **Thief is the NEXT ACTIVE design interview**, then Psion. After all eight normal Tier II designs, design the Quillboar area and major city. Some Tier II advancement mentors **MAY** move to the city, but their location and quests cannot be silently changed in this chat. **No Tier III class designing until World 2.** No secret class design during the current normal Tier II workflow.

## Grounded foundations vs unapproved ideas

**Already confirmed:**
- Thief is one of the **four standard Tier II Physically Blessed Novice branches**, eligible for advancement when the parent reaches **Tier I class level30**; a **new child manifestation at Tier II class level1**, not overwriting the parent. Keep the shared Echo class/manifestation state and ability purchasing rules.
- Physically Blessed is STR/AGI melee generalist with Mana. **USER-APPROVED THIEF-004: Thief uses MANA ONLY**, no new Energy, Stamina, Guile or Combo Point class resource. Attribute emphasis (likely AGI) and actual skill scaling remain open.
- Shared combat framework supports explicit per-class attack styles, hand-slot equipment, DoT/status tags, positional or dodge mechanics, conditional critical hits, and independent owner effects; **none are automatically unlocked on Thief**.
- The original `docs/TIER2_CORE_CLASSES_DESIGN_V02.md` suggested Rogue daggers. **USER-APPROVED THIEF-002 NOW CONFIRMS TWO ONE-HANDED DAGGERS equipped in mainhand+offhand**. All presently implemented equipment (not just the Thief's) is **ordinary stat-bearing gear/stat sticks for now**, with unique effects or Intrinsics on future authored items rather than automatically adding item procs now. Dual-wield attack animation/attack sequencing and offhand independent hit events were NOT chosen by user and remain OPEN.
- For recent Tier II classes, weighted class skill caps/gates target **roughly 80 purchasable ranks through Tier II level80**, with skills beginning rank0 and 1 point earned at level1 and per further level, but Thief's exact skill roster, rank caps and availability gates are NOT YET AUTHORED.

**DESIGNER SUGGESTIONS, NOT USER DECISIONS:**
- **AGI-leaning mobile melee physical damage dealer** with dual short blades, opportunistic positioning, quick chained basic strikes, selective dodges, and debuff/pickpocket-style tricks could differentiate Thief from Greatblade heavy Momentum attacks, Defender sword+shield tanking and Ranger physical ranged archery. But no permanent invisibility, positional damage bonus, dual wield rule, poison, crit multiplier, combo resource or special steal system should be assumed without explicit agreement.
- Potential visual class direction: dexterous nimble rogue in soft gear/hooded burglar silhouette; whether to use one male/female class body, race/species, oversized daggers and clothing are open.
- Could be **Thief** (scrappy dirty-tricks identity) rather than **Rogue** (stealthy professional) depending on user's fantasy. User currently approved name *Thief* as the branch label, while final shipping name can be changed explicitly if later desired.
- **USER-APPROVED THIEF-001:** ordinary Tier II Thief **blends fast assassin, evasive duelist and dirty-tricks burglar** traits. It is NOT forced to pick only one archetype and is not a dedicated advanced Assassin class. How much burst/dodge/trickery each six-skill kit ability has remains to decide. Preserve solo/party/boss viability.
- **USER-APPROVED THIEF-005: DO NOT DESIGN THIEF ADVANCEMENT QUEST YET.** The user wants to design its mentor, story, trial and location **AFTER the major city** is designed. Do not invent a city, NPC, quest objective or relocate other mentors now. Appearance model/race/look remains OPEN pending separate DiceFree working-chat/Codex REVIEW OF ALREADY-DOWNLOADED user assets (Rogue/Thief/Assassin/Ninja variants); the assets have not yet been inspected by this design interview and no specific model chosen.

## Thief — Round 1 five user answers recorded (2026-10-21)

- **THIEF-001 — USER CONFIRMED:** Tier II Thief is a **MIX** of **fast dagger assassin, agile duelist and dirty-tricks burglar**. User also explicitly wants to **SAVE all three as potential DIFFERENT TIER III archetypes for World 2**. These are **FUTURE CONCEPTS ONLY** — no Tier III skill kits, weapon rules, models, branching prerequisites or quests approved/designed now.
- **THIEF-002 — USER CONFIRMED:** TWO **one-handed daggers**, mainhand + offhand. **All equipment across DiceFree currently works as STAT STICKS**, without assuming unique gameplay effects until such special items are created later. No immediate dagger-specific proc/item identity/second independent autoattack schedule is approved.
- **THIEF-003 — USER CONFIRMED:** Thief has **SHORT STEALTH**. The **FIRST BASIC / NORMAL AUTOATTACK WHICH BREAKS STEALTH** deals BONUS DAMAGE. This is not automatically permanent invisibility or an always-on backstab passive. Exact stealth duration, cooldown/Mana, entrance/reveal, movement, enemy detection, combat-state permissions, positional bonuses and buff scaling need dedicated design.
- **THIEF-004 — USER CONFIRMED:** **MANA ONLY** for the class. Do NOT add combo points, energy, guile, trickery or a new Stamina bar during Tier II design unless user reverses decision. Abilities can still have timing/conditional buffs, without inventing resource systems.
- **THIEF-005 — USER CONFIRMED:** **Appearance MUST be decided in working/implementation chat with Codex** after consulting user's existing **downloaded Rogue/Thief/Assassin/Ninja art assets**. No new art generation/import or model chosen here. **Advancement NPC and quest MUST be designed AFTER the big city**, not while planning initial class skills. Some Tier II mentor locations might ultimately change there, later. The exact race/body/species/silhouette remains OPEN.

### Future-only Tier III inspiration — IDEAS BANK, not active designs

From THIEF-001, remember three future directions **for when the user starts World 2 Tier III design**:
- **Assassin archetype:** critical/ambush/burst identity (working archetype, NOT class approval).
- **Duelist archetype:** evasion/tempo/quick reactive attacks (working archetype, NOT class approval).
- **Dirty-Tricks Burglar archetype:** trickery/bleeds/debuffs/opportunism (working archetype, NOT class approval).

**None of these three is currently a committed Tier III branch or final shipping class name.** The user explicitly forbids Tier III design before World2. Do NOT expand these into kits/prerequisites/progression trees now.

### Equipment clarification — globally relevant

**USER says all equipment pieces are presently stat sticks**, including both dagger items. **Later specially authored item drops can gain UNIQUE EFFECTS/INTRINSICS**, which may modify skills for any class; no such specific effects are approved by this decision. Different item stats, offhand slot and gear restrictions are still meaningful; do not imply dual wielding automatically has two independent basic attack timers or two OnHit triggers. Weapon animation, base attack interval and dual-wield feel are character combat design, separate from item mechanics.

### Initial unapproved gameplay seeds for next discussion

- A short Stealth ability might become a brief movement/reposition window and empower its next melee basic attack, but exact invisibility/detection/combat permissions are undecided.
- A fast multi-stab physical active, a dodge/quickstep and a debuff/disruptive dirty trick could complement the stealth skill. No separate Combo resource.
- Passive AGI, basic attack speed, evasion or positional synergy remain ideas, not approved bonuses.
- The class could eventually have around six active/passive skill ranks and ~80 purchaseable ranks for Tier II level80, **but its skill roster and max ranks must be designed before choosing an exact schedule**.

## Round 2 — EXACTLY FIVE questions (AWAITING USER)

**THIEF-006 — Stealth timing and combat use:** How short should stealth last (for example **3–5 seconds**), and should Thief be able to activate it **while already fighting**, rather than only out of combat? I'd recommend combat usability for bosses and solo play, with an appropriate cooldown.

**THIEF-007 — Stealth-breaking basic attack:** Should the FIRST normal dagger autoattack breaking stealth add **extra flat Physical damage**, multiply that basic attack's damage (for example **+50%**), or be a **guaranteed crit**? Also, should attacking from behind add anything beyond the stealth bonus, or should that be reserved for a future Assassin?

**THIEF-008 — Dual-dagger basic-attack behavior:** As both equipped dagger ITEMS are stat sticks, do you want Thief's basic attack to be **one attack event with an alternating right/left stab animation**, or **two separate quick strikes/attack events** with their own timings? Both can show dual daggers without custom item procs; the former is simpler to balance.

**THIEF-009 — First other active abilities:** Which TWO should form Thief's early kit alongside Stealth: **a rapid multi-stab single-target attack**, **an evasive quickstep/dash**, or **a dirty trick like pocket sand that weakens/blinds briefly**? We can add the third later, but what should be the default level1 play pattern?

**THIEF-010 — Damage/defense emphasis and passive:** Should ordinary Tier II Thief mainly scale **AGI for physical damage**, with a LITTLE STR contribution, and should its passive lean toward **attack speed, basic-attack critical chance, or evasion**? No inherent crit is assumed under global combat rules; class skill/passive can explicitly grant it.
